2.12 -- 2007-08-06

  * Update POD documentation for mogadm to state of present code.

  * Add device-modify command for consistency with host/class.

  * Document return code behavior in the POD.

  * Provide specific return codes for list, listkey and locate when the item
    was not found.

  * Sometimes we get a - when we are expecting a numeric. Force these to zero.

  * Add locate task to mogtool that provides path output, useful in debugging.

  * Implement "device summary" per RT#3784. This provides an output with one
    line of storage data per host.

  * Handle stats where there are no files in the DB.

  * If there are hosts, but no devices, the totals were previously undefined,
    leading to errors in the output.
